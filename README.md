# SAS-Project--Forecast-Loan-Default-Model
The bank loan status data set obtained from Kaggle. We use 100,000 observations and 19 variables, including 2 binary variables, 8 nominal variables, and 11 continuous variables. We use data detection, establishing a linear regression model ,decision tree model and logistic regression model on the existing basic customer information and related materials, and conduct comparative analysis to find the best model. According to the model, the customer's credit risk situation is analyzed and scored, and the best credit score to distinguish good customers from bad customers is obtained, so that credit card companies can effectively deal with a large number of credit card applicants, quickly accept Judgment of rejection, and the initial credit limit given. For customers who borrow from a bank, we can use the model to distinguish the credit rating of the customer and help the bank determine whether it should borrow from the customer. Through analysis, we found that most customers are short-term loans, mainly liquidity.
